# Polymorphism in Java

Polymorphism is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class. The term "polymorphism" means "many forms," and it enables a single action to behave differently based on the object that it is acting upon.

## Types of Polymorphism

### 1. Compile-Time Polymorphism

Also known as static polymorphism, this type is achieved through method overloading. Method overloading allows multiple methods in the same class to have the same name but different parameters.

#### Example:

```java
class Helper {
    static int Multiply(int a, int b) {
        return a * b;
    }

    static double Multiply(double a, double b) {
        return a * b;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(Helper.Multiply(2, 4)); // Outputs 8
        System.out.println(Helper.Multiply(5.5, 6.3)); // Outputs 34.65
    }
}
```

### 2. Runtime Polymorphism

Also known as dynamic polymorphism, this type is achieved through method overriding. Method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.

#### Example:

```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal myDog = new Dog();
        myDog.sound(); // Outputs "Dog barks"
    }
}
```

## Benefits of Polymorphism

- **Code Reusability**: Polymorphism allows methods to be used interchangeably, promoting code reuse.
- **Flexibility**: It enables a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types).
- **Maintainability**: Polymorphic code is easier to maintain and extend.

Polymorphism is a powerful feature in Java that enhances the flexibility and maintainability of code by allowing a single interface to be used for different data types.
